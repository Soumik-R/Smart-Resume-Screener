## 🎤 Sample Jury Q&A Responses

**Q: What if the AI makes mistakes?**
A: "We provide detailed justifications for transparency. Recruiters can use the What-If Simulator to adjust scores and provide their expert judgment. The system augments human decision-making, not replaces it."

**Q: How scalable is this?**
A: "MongoDB backend handles thousands of candidates, API is async for concurrent processing, and the system can be deployed on cloud platforms for enterprise-scale usage."

**Q: What makes this different from existing tools?**
A: "Our What-If Simulator is unique - no other tool lets recruiters predict candidate potential dynamically. Plus, our five-dimensional scoring provides deeper insights than simple keyword matching."

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: "Yes! We've implemented error handling, fallback mechanisms, pagination, search, filtering, and professional UI/UX. The demo mode you're seeing works even without backend connectivity."

**Q: How accurate is the AI scoring?**
A: "We use OpenAI GPT-4 with carefully engineered prompts that evaluate candidates across five proven criteria. The AI provides explainable results, and the What-If tool allows human oversight."
